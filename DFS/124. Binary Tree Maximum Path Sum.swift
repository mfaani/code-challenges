/* LESSON: 
If you need to do a sum of things, then usually you need to just return upon even each traversal in your tree
If you need to do a min/max thing, then you usually need to have a global variable where you update it upon each iteration.
However if you needed to do a min/max on the sum, then likely youâ€™ll need to do both.

Pro-tip: 

Use 0 for paths with no value. 

Explanation: 
Why this works for negative an all negative nodes as well? 
It works because if you have a negative node or negative subAnswer, then it really has no value to be added. 
All that matters then is just the value of the node itself i.e. if you have [-5, -6, -8] 
then you first have an answer of -6. Set that as your max
then you have -8, but that doesn't force a change with your max. 
finally you get to -5, at this point you cancel the -6 & -8 with `max(maxGain(node.left), 0)` & ` max(maxGain(node.right), 0)` because they both return 0. 
and just then do a max between -5,-6 and then you'll answer is -5
